## Running the app
    - From the root, run 'python -m Src.app'

## Virtual Environment
    - Create a venv with the command 'python -m venv .venv' and activate it with:
        - 'source .venv/scripts/activate (windows users)
        - 'source .venv/bin/activate) (mac users)
    - Your shell should now say (.venv) under any command you input.
    - To deactivate your venv, enter 'deactivate' within your shell

## Requirements
    - Once your venv is activated, run the command 'pip install -r Requirements.txt' from the root of your repo
    - Updating Requirements:
        With your venv active, run 'pip freeze > Requirements.txt' from the root of your project

## Docker
    - Ensure the docker container is running by running the command, 'docker compose up'
